## About Me

I am a graduate student in Debora Marks' lab where I research ML for Biology. 

Most of my time is spent: 
-   designing new enzymes, 
-   developing new methods for combining natural sequence data with labeled experimental data, 
-   and mentoring future/current scientists. 

I've been the guest on a few podcasts! Listen to me talk science here:
- Finding Genius Podcast, New CRISPR Protein and Genome Editing Techniques Using Machine Learning Techniques, [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZSowMhWTuQ)
- BOS Science, Sound-Byte 2: PRIDE in STEM, [recording](https://bosscience.podbean.com/e/sound-byte-2-pride-in-stem/)
