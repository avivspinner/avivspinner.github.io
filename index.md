This website is under construction ! And possibly broken??

I am a graduate student in Debora Marks' lab where I research ML for Biology. 

Most of my time is spent: 
-   designing new enzymes, 
-   developing new methods for combining natural sequence data with labeled experimental data, 
-   and mentoring future/current PhD students.
