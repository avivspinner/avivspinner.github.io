# About Me

Hello ~ I am a Protein Engineering Machine Learning Fellow at [The Align Foundation](https://alignbio.org)

Current research interests include 
- [ ] understanding scaling laws for biology ML models,
- [ ] building beautiful visualizations of protein sequence data,
- [ ] producing high-throughput and high quality wetlab data,
- [ ] creating _useful_ evaluation benchmarks for the field of protein design.

## Graduate Training:
-   I did my PhD in Debora Marks' lab in the Department of Systems Biology at Harvad Medical School.
-   I was in the Biological and Biomedical Science PhD program as well as the Therapeutics Graduate Program.
-   Here's a link to [my thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/f778804e6685494f993d529dbf3f0ce7/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y)! The acknowledgments are honesty the best part ;)

#### During graduate school, most of my time was spent: 
- [x] designing new enzymes,
- [x] building benchmarks and evaluations for predicting variant effects and generating new molecules,
- [x] developing methods for combining natural sequence data with labeled experimental data, 
- [x] and mentoring future/current scientists. 

## Undergraduate Training:
-   I studied Genetics and Plant Biology at UC Berkeley (**go bears!**) with a minor in Food Systems.
-   Notably, I took "calculus for business majors" in 2014 and did not take another math class until graduate school in 2021! :sob:
-   I poked CasX with Ben Oakes in the labs of Dave Savage and Jennifer Doudna.

#### During undergraduate training, most of my time was spent: 
- [x] pipetting
- [x] more pipetting...
- [x] honestly, it was so much pipetting
- [x] working in a bakery (i.e. pipetting at scale)
- [x] writing 3 min, 10 min, and full length plays with T4C (aka [Theater for Charity](https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/theaterforcharity]) )


#### Much of my research is published on open platforms. 
If there's a paper that is published elsewhere that you'd like full access to, please email me and I will get you a PDF. 

I've been the guest on a few podcasts! Listen to me talk science here:
